## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [ ] View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
  - [x] Mobile, < 600px
  - [ ] Tablet, 600px+
  - [ ] Desktop, 800px+
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- [x] See the correct content for the Family Gatherings, Special Events, and Social Events section when the user clicks each tab
- [ ] Receive an error message when the booking form is submitted if:
  - [ ] The `Name` or `Email Address` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - [ ] The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
  - [ ] Any of the `Pick a date` or `Pick a time` fields are empty should show "This field is incomplete"

## My process

### Built with

- <b>[Angular](https://angular.io/)</b> (<b>JavaScript</b> framework)
  - Reactive Forms üò≠
  - TypeScript
  - JavaScript
  - <s>[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)</s>
- <b>Figma</b>
- <b>Sass/CSS</b> custom properties
  - <s><b>[fxLayout API](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/wiki/fxLayout-API)</b> Angular Flexbox API</s>
  - <b>Mobile-first</b> workflow
- Semantic <b>HTML5</b> markup


### What I learned


<!-- - While building this project I learned more about <b>Figma</b>, apparently most of the <b>CSS</b> variables and styles may be available in your <b>Figma</b> file, which saves SO much time. Who knew? üòã
- This is also one of my first "real" projects using <b>Angular</b>, <s>overall everything went very smoothly, and I enjoy working with <b>Angular</b>. <b>Angular</b>, it seems much more intuitive and organized than <b>React</b>ü§°</s>.
- Please see below, for a code snippet, of the Angular Reactive Form that actually broke my soul. I will not be elaborating üëâüèæ üëàüèæ -->

#### `rezzo-form.component.html`
```html
    <form class="rezForm"
      [formGroup]="rezzoForm"
      (ngSubmit)="onSubmitForm()"
      >

        <input type="text"
          placeholder="Name"
          formControlName="name"
          >
            ...

            <h3>Pick a Date</h3>
              ...
          
          <select 
              formControlName="month"
              type="text"
              (change)="selectMonth($event)">
                
                <option disabled>MM</option>
                <option *ngFor="let month of months"
                  [ngValue]="month">
                  {{ month }}
                  </option>
              </select>

          [disabled]="!rezzoForm.valid"
          type="submit">
          Make Reservation
        </button>
      </form>
```
#### `rezzo-form.component.ts`
```js
    import { FormBuilder, FormGroup, } from '@angular/forms';

    ...

    export class RezzoFormComponent implements OnInit {
      rezzoForm: FormGroup;
      ...
      months: string[] = [
        'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 
        'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sept', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'

        '6 people', '7 people', '8 people', '9 people', '10 people'
        ];
      selectedGuestCount: number = 4;
      ...

      constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) { }

      ngOnInit(): void {
        this.initializeForm();
      }

      initializeForm(): void {
        this.rezzoForm = this.fb.group({
          ...
          month: 'MM',
          ...
          meridian: 'PM',
          guests: this.guests[this.selectedGuestCount + 1],
        })
      };

      decrementGuestCount() {
        if (this.selectedGuestCount > 1) {
          this.selectedGuestCount = this.selectedGuestCount - 1
        }
      }
      incrementGuestCount() {
        ...
      }

      onSubmitForm() {
        ...
      }

      selectMonth(event): void {
        this.rezzoForm.patchValue({
          month: event.target.value
        })
      }
      ...
    }
```

### Useful resources

- [Reactive forms](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms) - This helped me... I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- üôåüèæ [Angular Reactive Forms in 10 Minutes](https://youtu.be/MMP_OcjWNQo) - This is an amazing YouTube which helped me finally understand how to build Reactive Forms with Angular. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [/angular/flex-layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout) - <s>This helped me because it's much easier to incorporate <b>Flexbox</b> into a <b>template</b> than a <b>CSS</b> stylesheet ü§î . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.</s> Now, I prefer to create flex styles with <i>Sass</i>
