## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [ ] View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
  - [x] Mobile, < 600px
  - [x] Tablet, 600px+
  - [ ] Desktop, 800px+
- [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- [x] See the correct content for the Family Gatherings, Special Events, and Social Events section when the user clicks each tab
- [ ] Receive an error message when the booking form is submitted if:
  - [ ] The `Name` or `Email Address` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - [ ] The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
  - [ ] Any of the `Pick a date` or `Pick a time` fields are empty should show "This field is incomplete"

### Screenshot

<!-- ![](./screenshot.jpg) -->

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- <b>[Angular](https://angular.io/)</b> <b>JavaScript</b> framework
  - Reactive Forms
  - 
  - TypeScript
  - JavaScript
  - <s>[Angualar Material](https://material.angular.io/)</s>
- Semantic <b>HTML5</b> markup
- <b>Figma</b>
- <b>Sass/CSS</b> custom properties
- <b>[fxLayout API](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout/wiki/fxLayout-API)</b> Angular Flexbox API
- <b>Mobile-first</b> workflow

### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

- While building this project I learned more about <b>Figma</b>, apparently most of the <b>CSS</b> variables and styles may be available in your <b>Figma</b> file, which saves SO much time. Who knew? üòã
- This is also one of my first "real" projects using <b>Angular</b>, overall everything went very smoothly, and I enjoy working with <b>Angular</b>. <b>Angular</b>, it seems much more intuitive and organized than <b>React</b>.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("üéâ");
};
```

### Continued development

- [ ] Add animations
- [ ] Add an authentication option, where a manager/admin can login with a password and
  - [ ] view/edit menu options
  - [ ] view/edit menu event options
  - [ ] view/edit menu reservations
- [ ] add about chef/restaraunt section/page
- [ ] add menu component
- [ ] add event booking component
